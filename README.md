   - Visit [Anaconda's download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows/MacOS/Linux)
   - Download the Python 3.x version (latest stable release)

2. Install Anaconda:
   - Windows: Run the .exe installer and follow the prompts
   - MacOS: Run the .pkg installer
   - Linux: Run the bash script in terminal
   ```bash
   bash Anaconda3-20xx.xx-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

3. Verify Installation:
   Open terminal/command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```

### 2. Setting Up Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive development environment ideal for this project.

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator and click on Jupyter Notebook, or
   - Open terminal/command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Create a New Environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name pose_detection python=3.8
   conda activate pose_detection
   ```

3. Install Required Dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda install tensorflow tensorflow-hub

   conda install scikit-learn
   ```

## Detailed Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Data Collection and Processing
```python
def select_training_videos(dataset_path, num_videos=12):
    """Select a random subset of videos for training."""
```
**Purpose**: This function randomly selects videos for training, ensuring we have a diverse dataset. We use 12 videos by default to have enough data while keeping processing manageable.

**Implementation Details**:
- Scans directory for video files (.mp4, .avi, .mov)
- Randomly selects specified number of videos
- Returns list of video paths

### 2. Frame Extraction
```python
def extract_frames(video_path, output_dir, frame_interval=10):
    """Extract frames from video at specified intervals."""
```
**Purpose**: Converts videos into individual frames for processing. We use frame intervals to:
- Reduce redundant data (consecutive frames are often very similar)
- Manage storage and processing requirements
- Maintain temporal diversity in our dataset

**Implementation Details**:
- Opens video using OpenCV
- Extracts frames at regular intervals
- Saves frames as images for later processing

### 3. Data Augmentation
```python
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    brightness_range=[0.8, 1.2],
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
```
**Purpose**: Increases dataset size and variety by creating modified versions of original images. This helps the model:
- Learn to handle different poses and positions
- Become more robust to variations
- Prevent overfitting

**Implementation Details**:
- Applies random rotations (Â±20 degrees)
- Shifts images horizontally and vertically
- Adjusts brightness
- Performs horizontal flips
- Maintains aspect ratios and fills empty spaces

### 4. Model Architecture
```python
class PoseModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(PoseModel, self).__init__()
        self.movenet = hub.load('https://tfhub.dev/google/movenet/singlepose/lightning/4')
```
**Purpose**: Creates a hybrid model combining MoveNet's pre-trained features with custom layers for our specific task.

**Key Components**:
1. **MoveNet Base**:
   - Pre-trained pose detection model
   - Provides initial feature extraction
   - Helps identify basic pose features

2. **Custom Layers**:
   ```python
   self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')
   self.conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, 3, activation='relu')
   ```
   - Additional convolutional layers for feature refinement
   - Increasing complexity of feature detection

3. **Dense Layers**:
   ```python
   self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')
   self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')
   ```
   - Final processing for keypoint prediction
   - Gradual reduction in dimensionality
   - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

### 5. Training Process
```python
def train_pose_model(train_data, val_data, epochs=20, batch_size=8):
```
**Purpose**: Trains the model on our prepared dataset with several optimizations:

1. **Custom Loss Function**:
   ```python
   def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
       mse_loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
       mae_loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
       return 0.7 * mse_loss + 0.3 * mae_loss
   ```
   - Combines MSE and MAE losses
   - Balances between large and small errors
   - Provides stable training

2. **Learning Rate Schedule**:
   - Reduces learning rate when progress plateaus
   - Helps fine-tune model in later stages
   - Prevents overshooting optimal values

3. **Early Stopping**:
   - Prevents overfitting
   - Saves best model weights
   - Optimizes training time

### 6. Evaluation and Testing
```python
class PoseTestingUtils:
    def test_on_video(self, video_path):
```
**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive testing of the trained model:

1. **Video Processing**:
   - Real-time pose detection
   - FPS calculation
   - Performance metrics

2. **Robustness Testing**:
   - Different lighting conditions
   - Various angles
